    <iscomment>Array of client versions this code supports
    If you make a change on the client that requires specific server changes,
      then you should reset this array to be the current client version.
    If you make a change on the server, but the client does not depend on the change and does not need to be updated,
       then you should add to this array to say that a client update is not required.
